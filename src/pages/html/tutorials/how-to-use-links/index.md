## How to Use Links

You can create links in your HTML page by creating an <a> element. Here's an example:
  
 ```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Link to Google</a>
```

It's common to embed the <a> element into other elements and style them accordingly. It's also possible to style the <a> elements itself and turn it into a button by adding padding, or a circle using styling as you like.
